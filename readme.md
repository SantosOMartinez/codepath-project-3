<!-- Replace this with whatever GIF tool you used! -->
<!-- Note: Used MP4 video format instead of GIF as the file size was way smaller at a higher quality.-->
Video created with:
- Recorded in QuickTime Player
- Edited in Final Cut Pro
- Compressor for file format conversion
<!-- Recommended tools:
[Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS
[ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows
[peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux. -->

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was unable to display the page sheet title for the similar movies view. I don't exactly know where I would go to change this as I tried many properties that should directly tackle this but it seems I am missing some key context.
